"Sneaker Drops"

    As a group, we have decided on a final idea for a database that could be interesting and helpful for users. The database we will be making is named "Sneaker Drops". In this database we will be working with information related to new sneaker releases. 

Sneaker releases, otherwise known as sneaker "drops", is a unique database. New sneakers are a hot topic for many young adults who are into fashion. This database is for those individuals that are looking to get into the game, but don't know where to start when it comes to new releases and how to get their hands on them. This will be a new business we have developed that incorporates businesses already up and running. We will import data from the websites StockX, GOAT, and Grailed to gain real data on shoes hot on the market today. We will help our users find a new drop for the best price available so they can make their purchase.

The five tables held in this database are the sneaker being released, the retail price, websites the shoe is being sold on, the lowest price found, the highest price found, and the number of vendors selling the shoe. Our end user data will be the price that the customer who was using the database ended up paying for their sneakers. This will greatly contribute to the database when it comes to data for future users to look at. The entities of this database are the tables: sneaker being released, retail price, websites the shoe is being sold on, lowest price found, highest price found, number of vendors selling shoes, and price customer paid.

To get as specific as we can, we have a great amount of attributes that will allow for more detail on our tables. Sneaker style, designer, and brand will be used under the Sneaker table to describe the product. Contained in the Websites Sold On table will be the three previously mentioned businesses, GOAT, StockX, and Grailed. For the tables Lowest Price Sold on Site and Highest Price Sold on Site, our attributes will be the condition of the sneaker. The three businesses we are looking at offer buyers to purchase used or new sneakers. This can greatly affect the price and that is why it is a valuable attribute to aware of. In our vendors table, our attributes will be a few vendors names on a particular site that we can look at for data. Lastly, we have the attributes of our end user table, Price Customer Paid. The attributes associated with this table are site purchased on, vendor purchased from, the condition of the sneaker purchased, and price. 

For a visual aid of this idea, we have created two tables that explain the entities and information surrounding them. In table 1, a diagram is shown with the name of the database, the tables contained within the database, and the attributes that can be found in each table. In table 2, a diagram is shown connecting the entities with the relationships that connect them. This can further explain the reason for why all tables are relevant to not only the topic, but to each other.

Table 2


Our goal for the sneaker drops database, however, is more than just to give the user data where to find and how much it will cost to buy a new sneaker release. This database can also be used in a different sense and for a different kind of user. Our database can also provide data that will allow vendors to figure out what they can get for resale if they decide to resell a shoe. In a sense, the table for them will act as a stock portfolio where they can track prices and find price trends.

The user will use the retail price table, lowest and higest price tables, and website being sold on table to reach their purcashing goal. If they are interested on working towards the goal of resale, they can use the used sneaker price provided in the lowest and highest price tables and the data from previous prices customers paid that is collected in the end user data table.
